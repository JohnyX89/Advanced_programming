## Scenario
Imagine TripAdvisor. Is there any functionality which would improve this gigant in the trip applications? Well, ask yourself: "How are you motivated to recommend some place to stay, eat or to do something interesting?" Yes, beside that you want to share just your experiences from your own will, you can now even earn some money by doing so and that is amazing, don't you think? Plus, it is decentralized, meaning no one can pay money to remove their negative reviews.
