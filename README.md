## Scenario
Imagine TripAdvisor. Is there any functionality which would improve this gigant in the trip applications? Well, ask yourself: "How are you motivated to recommend some place to stay, eat or to do something interesting?" Yes, beside that you want to share just your experiences from your own will, you can now even earn some money by doing so and that is amazing, don't you think? Plus, it is decentralized, meaning no one can pay money to remove their negative reviews.

8. UpVote the challenged item
9. DownVote the challenged item

## Used Technologies
- Solidity
- Ethereum blokchain
- Graph https://thegraph.com/en/
- React
- (AWS s3, DynamoDB)

## Questions
- Is blockchain safe?
  - Of course. It is decentralized and promoting transparency and community engagement. 
- How many lists can be there?
  - infinite, since we are utilizing the power of the blockchain and lists have their own contracts
- How many listings can be there?
  - infinite, lists have their own contracts and as many subjects as uint256
